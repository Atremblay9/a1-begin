                        <h2>Choosing a Breed</h2>

                              <p>Growing your tribe by four paws is a big decision. After all, you’re about to find your new best friend.</p>

                              <p>It’s important to acknowledge that every dog has different characteristics and some may be a better fit for your lifestyle than others.</p>

                              <p>But with so many cute furry faces staring at you every time you visit your local shelter (it happened to me), it can be overwhelming trying to decide which one of those wagging tails and slobbery smiles you want to make your own.</p>
