            <h2>Choosing a Breed</h2>

            <p>Growing your tribe by four paws is a big decision. After all, you’re about to find your new best friend.</p>

            <p>But with so many cute furry faces staring at you every time you visit your local shelter (it happened to me), it can be overwhelming trying to decide which one of those wagging tails and slobbery smiles you want to make your own.</p>
